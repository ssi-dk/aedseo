aedseo(
  tsd,
  k = 5,
  level = 0.95,
  disease_threshold = NA_integer_,
  family = c("poisson", "quasipoisson"),

}
\arguments{
\item{tsd}{A \code{aedseo_tsd} object containing time series data with 'time' and
'observed.'}

\item{k}{An integer specifying the window size for modeling growth rates.}

\item{level}{The confidence level for parameter estimates, a numeric value
between 0 and 1.}

\item{disease_threshold}{An integer specifying the threshold for considering
a disease outbreak.}

\item{family}{A character string specifying the family for modeling.
Choose between "poisson," or "quasipoisson".}

\item{na_percentage_allowed}{A percentage input as a numeric value that determines
how many NA values that are allowed in the observations for each k window}
}
\value{
A \code{aedseo} object containing:
\itemize{
\item 'reference_time': The time point for which the growth rate is estimated.
\item 'observed': The observed value in the reference time point.
\item 'growth_rate': The estimated growth rate.
\item 'lower_growth_rate': The lower bound of the growth rate's confidence
interval.
\item 'upper_growth_rate': The upper bound of the growth rate's confidence
interval.
\item 'growth_warning': Logical. Is the growth rate significantly higher than
zero?
\item 'sum_of_cases': The sum of cases within the time window.
\item 'sum_of_cases_warning': Logical. Does the Sum of Cases exceed the
disease threshold?
\item 'seasonal_onset_alarm': Logical. Is there a seasonal onset alarm?
\item 'skipped_window': Logical. Was the window skipped?
\item 'converged': Logical. Was the IWLS judged to have converged?

This function performs automated and early detection of seasonal epidemic
onsets (aedseo) on a time series dataset. It estimates growth rates for
consecutive time intervals and calculates the sum of cases (sum_of_cases).
