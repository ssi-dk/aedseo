\usage{
aedseo(tsd, k = 5, level = 0.95, family = c("poisson", "quasipoisson"))
}
\arguments{
\item{tsd}{A \code{aedseo_tsd} object containing time series data with 'time,'
'observed,' and 'periodInYear.'}

\item{k}{An integer specifying the window size for modeling growth rates.}

\item{level}{The confidence level for parameter estimates, a numeric value
between 0 and 1.}

\item{family}{A character string specifying the family for modeling.
Choose between "poisson," or "quasipoisson".}
}
\value{
A tibble containing:
\itemize{
\item 'reference_time': The time point for which the growth rate is estimated.
\item 'observed': The observed value in the reference time point.
\item 'growth_rate': The estimated growth rate.
\item 'lower_growth_rate': The lower bound of the growth rate's confidence
interval.
\item 'upper_growth_rate': The upper bound of the growth rate's confidence
interval.
\item 'growth_warning': Logical. Is the growth rate significantly higher than
zero?
\item 'sum_of_cases': The Sum of Cases within the time window.
\item 'converged': Logical. Was the IWLS judged to have converged?
}

This function performs automated and early detection of seasonal epidemic
onsets (aedseo) on a time series dataset. It estimates growth rates for
consecutive time intervals and calculates the Sum of Cases (sum_of_cases).
