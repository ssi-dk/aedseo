\title{Summarises estimates like seasonal peak and onset from all available seasons}
\usage{
historical_summary(onset_output)
}
\arguments{
\item{onset_output}{A \code{tsd_onset} object returned from \code{seasonal_onset()}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{historical_summary}, containing:
\itemize{
\item Usual time to seasonal peak (weeks after onset)
\item The week in which the peak usually falls
\item Usual peak intensity
\item The week in which the onset usually falls
\item Usual onset intensity and lower growth rate (How significant)
}
}
\description{
This function summarises peak timing and seasonal onset from estimates in a \code{tsd_onset} object.
This can be useful for investigating if the current season falls within estimates from previous seasons
or if it is very distinct from previous seasons.

Uses data from a \code{tsd_onset} object (output from \code{seasonal_onset()}).
