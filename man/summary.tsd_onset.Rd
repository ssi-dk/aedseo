\title{Summary method for \code{tsd_onset} objects}
\usage{
\method{summary}{tsd_onset}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class 'tsd_onset' containing the results of a seasonal_onset analysis.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not used).}

\value{
This function is used for its side effect, which is printing a summary message to the console.
}
\description{
Summarize the results of an seasonal onset analysis, including the latest growth rate estimate,
the confidence interval, and information about growth warnings.

\examples{
# Create a `tsd_onset` object from sample data

  time = as.Date(c(

    "2023-01-05",
    "2023-01-06"

# Calculate seasonal_onset results with a 3-day window and a Poisson family model

  level = 0.95,
