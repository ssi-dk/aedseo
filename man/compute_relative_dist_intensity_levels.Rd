\usage{
compute_relative_dist_intensity_levels(
  weighted_observations,
  disease_threshold = 20,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{weighted_observations}{A tibble containing two columns of length n; \code{observed}, which contains the data
points, and \code{weight}, which is the importance assigned to the observation. Higher weights indicate that an
observation has more influence on the model outcome, while lower weights reduce its impact.}

\item{disease_threshold}{An integer specifying the threshold for considering a disease outbreak. It defines the per
time-step disease threshold that has to be surpassed for the observation to be included in the calculations.}

\item{...}{arguments that can be passed to the \code{compute_weighted_intensity_levels} function.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing:
\itemize{
\item 'very_low_level' The very low intensity level.
\item 'low_level': The low intensity level.
\item 'medium_level': The medium intensity level.
\item 'high_level': The high intensity level.
\item 'relative_dist': The relative distance between levels.
\item 'high_conf_level': The conf level for the high intensity level.
\item 'optim_fit_par_1': The first fit parameter for the chosen family.
\itemize{
\item For 'weibull': Shape parameter (k).
\item For 'lnorm': Mean of the log-transformed observations.
\item For 'exp': Rate parameter (λ).
}
\item 'optim_fit_par_2': The second fit parameter for the chosen family.
\itemize{
\item For 'weibull': Scale parameter (λ).
\item For 'lnorm': Standard deviation of the log-transformed observations.
\item For 'exp': Not applicable (set to NA).
}
\item 'obj_value': The value of the objective function.
(negative log-likelihood), which represent the minimized objective
function value from the optimisation. Smaller value equals better
optimisation.
\item 'converged': Logical. TRUE if the optimisation converged.
\item 'family': The distribution family used for the optimization.
\itemize{
\item 'weibull': Uses the Weibull distribution for fitting.
\item 'lnorm': Uses the Log-normal distribution for fitting.
\item 'exp': Uses the Exponential distribution for fitting.

This function calculates the intensity levels of weighted time series observations. The output contains very low,
low, medium, high intensity levels, that predict the intensity levels of the next series of observations.
It uses the highest level from the \code{compute_weighted_intensity_levels} function as the high intensity level and
the disease_threshold as the very low intensity level.
