\title{Predict Growth Rates for Future Time Steps}
\usage{
\method{predict}{seasonal_onset}(object, n_step = 3, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A model object created using the \code{seasonal_onset()} function.}

\item{n_step}{An integer specifying the number of future time steps for which you want to predict growth rates.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not used).}
}
\value{
A tibble S3 object called \code{seasonal_onset} containing the predicted growth rates, including time,
estimated growth rate, lower confidence interval, and upper confidence interval for the specified number of
future time steps.
}
\description{
This function is used to predict future growth rates based on a model object created using the 'aedseo' package.
It takes the model object and the number of future time steps (\code{n_step}) for which you want to make predictions and
returns a prediction tibble.
}

# Analyze the data using the aedseo package

    "2023-01-05",
    "2023-01-06"
  )),
  time_interval = "day"
)

tsd_results <- seasonal_onset(

# Predict growth rates for the next 5 time steps
