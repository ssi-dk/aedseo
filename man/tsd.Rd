\title{Create a S3 \code{tsd} (time-series data) object from observed data and corresponding dates.}
\usage{
tsd(observation, time, time_interval = c("day", "week", "month"))
}
\arguments{
\item{observation}{A numeric vector containing the observations.}

\item{time}{A date vector containing the corresponding dates.}

\item{time_interval}{A character vector specifying the time interval.
Choose between "day," "week," or "month."}
}
\value{
A \code{tsd} object containing:
\itemize{
\item 'time': The time point for for when the observation is observed.
\item 'observation': The observed value at the time point.
}
}
\description{
This function takes observations and the corresponding date vector and converts it into a \code{tsd} object, which is
a time series data structure that can be used for time series analysis.
}

# Create a `tsd` object from daily data
