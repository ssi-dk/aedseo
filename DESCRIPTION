Description: A powerful tool for automating the early detection of seasonal epidemic
             onsets in time series data. It offers the ability to estimate growth rates
             across consecutive time intervals, calculate the sum of cases (SoC) within
             those intervals, and estimate seasonal onsets within user defined seasons.
             With use of a disease-specific threshold it also offers the possibility to
             estimate seasonal onset of epidemics.
             Additionally it offers the ability to estimate burden levels for seasons
             based on historical data. It is aimed towards epidemiologists,
             public health professionals, and researchers seeking to identify and respond
             to seasonal epidemics in a timely fashion.
