Description: A powerful tool for automating the early detection of seasonal epidemic
             onsets in time series data. It offers the ability to estimate growth rates
             for consecutive time intervals, calculate the sum of cases (SoC) within
             those intervals, and estimate seasonal onsets for user defined seasons.
             Additionally it offers the ability to estimate burden levels for seasons
             based on historical data. It is particularly useful for epidemiologists,
             public health professionals, and researchers seeking to identify and respond
             to seasonal epidemics in a timely fashion.
             For reference on growth rate estimation, see Walling and Lipstich (2007)
             <doi:10.1098/rspb.2006.3754> and Obadia et al. (2012) <doi:10.1186/1472-6947-12-147>.
             Seasonal burden level calculations have been inspired by The Moving Epidemic
             Method (MEM), see Vega and Lozano (2012) <doi:10.1111/j.1750-2659.2012.00422.x>.
