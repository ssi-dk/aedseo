# aedseo: Automated and Early Detection of Seasonal Epidemic Onset and Burden Levels

A powerful tool for automating the early detection of seasonal epidemic
onsets in time series data. It offers the ability to estimate growth
rates across consecutive time intervals, calculate the sum of cases
(SoC) within those intervals, and estimate seasonal onsets within user
defined seasons. With use of a disease-specific threshold it also offers
the possibility to estimate seasonal onset of epidemics. Additionally it
offers the ability to estimate burden levels for seasons based on
historical data. It is aimed towards epidemiologists, public health
professionals, and researchers seeking to identify and respond to
seasonal epidemics in a timely fashion.
