#' Fit a peak algorithm to time series observations in a set of seasons.
#'
#' @description
#' `r lifecycle::badge("stable")`
#'
#' This function calculates the intensity levels of peak time series
#' observations to the next comming season based on previouse seasons.
#' Peak observations are the n highest observations from each season.
#' It provides low, medium, high intensity levels, that reflect the
#' current intensity of infection based on previous seasons. Hence it
#' uses the peak observations from each previous season it can only
#' explain the current intensity in relation to the peak of the season.
#'
#' @param weighted_observations A tibble containing two columns of size n;
#' `observation`, which represents the data points, and `weight`, which is the
#' importance assigned to an observation. Higher weights indicate that an
#' observation has more influence on the model outcome, while lower weights
#' reduce its impact. The structure is:
#' `weighted_observations = tibble(observation = c(...), weight = c(...))`
#' @param conf_levels The confidence levels for parameter estimates, a numeric
#' vector of length 3. Default is c(0.50, 0.90, 0.95).
#' @param family A character string specifying the family for
#' modeling. Choose between "weibull", "lnorm" or "exp".
#' @param optim_method A character string specifying the method to be used in
#' the optimisation. Lookup ?optim::stats for details about methods.
#' Default is Nelder-Mead. If using the exp family it is recomended to use
#' Brent as it is a one-dimensional optimisation.
#' @param lower_optim A numeric value for the optimisation. Default is -Inf.
#' @param upper_optim A numeric value for the optimisation. Default is Inf.
#'
#' @return A tibble containing:
#'   - 'high_level': The highest peak intensity level
#'   - 'medium_level': The medium peak intensity level
#'   - 'low_level': The lowest intensity level
#'   - 'optim_fit_par_1': The first fit parameter for the chosen family.
#'       - For 'weibull': Shape parameter (k).
#'       - For 'lnorm': Mean of the log-transformed observations.
#'       - For 'exp': Rate parameter (λ).
#'   - 'optim_fit_par_2': The second fit parameter for the chosen family.
#'      - For 'weibull': Scale parameter (λ).
#'      - For 'lnorm': Standard deviation of the log-transformed observations.
#'      - For 'exp': Not applicable (set to NA).
#'   - 'obj_value': The value of the objective function
#'     (negative log-likelihood), which represent the minimized objective
#'      function value from the optimisation. Smaller value equals better
#'      optimisation.
#'   - 'converged': Logical. TRUE if the optimisation converged.
#'   - 'family': The distribution family used for the optimization.
#'      - 'weibull': Uses the Weibull distribution for fitting.
#'      - 'lnorm': Uses the Log-normal distribution for fitting.
#'      - 'exp': Uses the Exponential distribution for fitting.
